            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>My name is Nathaniel Blake Everett Gordon, I prefer to be called Blake. Fun fact about me is people are impressed with the length of my name, I have 2 middle names
            and rarely use my first nmae. I went to Kansas state university on a track scholoarship and majored in computer science/minor in management. For the past decade I've worked
            in management for various shipping companies and currently work with Old dominion. I'm currently working my way into the IT field, as I'm switching gears to do my major and hope
            work closely with the Old Dominion IT department.
